Report Overview

Insulated paints is a type of paint that blocks the transfer of heat through walls and reduces unwanted radiant heat loss and heat gain into a structure. Insulating paints can reflect or block heat from all sources such as heaters, fireplaces, radiators, and sunlight inside a building. These paints can either be applied to the interior wall or can be mixed with an additive on an existing paint. These paints are water based, and thus are non-toxic and environment friendly. They offer high thermal coefficient and low thermal conductivity preventing insulation and reflecting the infrared rays.
